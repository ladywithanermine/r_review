output: html_document
---

## Objective
Use MCMC to predict housing prices and identify key price determinants.

## Dataset
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mennatullahelzarqa/the-boston-housing-dataset">Boston Housing Dataset</a>

## Business Question
What are the key factors influencing housing prices, and how can we predict prices for new properties?

## Steps

1. *Preprocessing*: Handle missing values, scale numerical variables, and prepare the dataset for regression analysis.
2. *Model Specification*: Use a Bayesian multiple regression model to predict housing prices based on features like room count, neighborhood quality, and proximity to amenities.
3. *MCMC Implementation*: Fit the model using JAGS or Stan, capturing posterior distributions for all coefficients.
4. *Analysis*: Compare Bayesian predictions with traditional regression estimates and identify credible intervals for key predictors.

## Deliverables

- Predicted housing prices for a test set of properties.
- Insights into the most important factors influencing prices.
